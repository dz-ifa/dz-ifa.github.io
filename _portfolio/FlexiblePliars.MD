### Print-in-Place Functional Design

Print-in-place models are a fascinating realm of 3D printing. These models are designed to work immediately upon removal from the print bed, with no post-processing or assembly required. They achieve this functionality by carefully creating clearance between printed joints, allowing for necessary motion and rotation. In some cases, as in our pliers, incorporating a flexible element is essential to obtain useful motion. Print-In-Place design extend far beyond needle nose pliers. For instance, in the medical field, print-in-place parts can be used to design intricate surgical instruments that function seamlessly from the printer, saving valuable time in critical procedures. In the realm of robotics, it's possible to create articulated joints that move as soon as they're printed, eliminating the need for manual assembly and reducing the risk of human error.

**Objective**
The design of the 3D printed needle nose pliers is an intricate blend of both PLA and TPU materials, with the central focus on the flexible TPU spring component.

**Spring Component Design:**

The TPU spring component was a critical element in ensuring the smooth and automatic operation of the pliers. It was designed to provide the necessary elasticity for the pliers to grip and pick up through-hole resistors effectively. The design process for this spring involved meticulous consideration of its shape, thickness, and overall geometry.

Creating a functional spring within a 3D printed part required a careful balance between rigidity and flexibility. The spring's thickness, width, and curvature were optimized to provide just the right amount of resilience. A more extensive and thinner spring design offered enhanced flexibility, which translated to a higher capacity for the pliers to open and close, but at the expense of durability. On the other hand, a thicker spring improved durability but slightly limited the pliers' capacity.

**Integration into the Model:**

The ingenious part of this design was the seamless integration of the TPU spring into the PLA pliers. While PLA is rigid and inflexible, TPU possesses excellent elasticity and flexibility. To ensure the TPU spring component was effectively retained within the model, a combination of careful design considerations and precise tolerances was employed.

The PLA sections of the pliers, including the handles and the jaws, were designed with specific channels and sockets. These allowed the TPU spring to snugly fit into the designated areas while ensuring that it would not detach or dislodge during use.

The design also included interlocking mechanisms, where the TPU spring was intricately connected to the PLA parts. This design approach facilitated the functional operation of the pliers while maintaining a secure and stable connection between the two materials.

The successful retention of the TPU spring within the PLA pliers was a testament to the effectiveness of this dual-material design. It ensured the pliers operated smoothly and efficiently, while also highlighting the potential of combining different materials in 3D printing to achieve complex, functional designs.

In conclusion, the design of these needle nose pliers elegantly leveraged the unique properties of PLA and TPU materials to create a functional, print-in-place tool. The TPU spring component, with its carefully optimized design and seamless integration, played a pivotal role in making these pliers a successful example of innovative 3D printing.

**Specifications: Jaw Length and Capacity**

The specifications for the pliers included jaw length and capacity. These were fine-tuned to ensure that the pliers would effectively grip and pick up through-hole resistors.

**Print Settings**

Achieving the right print settings is crucial for print-in-place models with different materials. This project used PLA is a rigid, non-flexible filament, and TPU a material known for its elasticity. I was able to print both materials using one dual extrusions printer.  The TPU print head was set to an extrusion temperature around 200°C without a cooling fan. The PLA was printed around 190°C with the cooling fan on. The build plate was heated to 50°C with the printer doors closed and a thin layer of a glue stick. In order to precent oozing a ooze tower was used to minimize stringing.
