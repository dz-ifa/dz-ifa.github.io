# Project Overview  

## Introduction 
This project involves designing and 3D printing a phone holder for bikes or scooters and used a top-down modeling approach. The goal is to create a secure and adjustable phone mount that can be quickly attached to handlebars without the need for additional tools.


## Design Criteria  
### Attaching Holder to Handlebars 
The holder must securely grip handlebars with a diameter of 23-25 mm without causing any damage or requiring drilling. Installation is tool-free, and the holder remains on the bike. 
### Attaching Phone to Holder 
The holder securely grips the phone without obstructing any functions like charging or the screen. Phone installation into the holder takes only seconds and doesn't require additional tools. 
### Adjustability 
The holder allows the phone to be locked in both vertical and horizontal orientations, changeable during a ride. Additional adjustability, such as viewing angle, is a welcome feature. 


# Design Choices


**What is top-down modeling?**

Top-down modeling is a design approach that starts with the overall shape and function of a product, and then works down to the individual components. This approach ensures that the final product is coherent, functional, and user-friendly.

**Benefits of Top-Down Modeling**

-   Ensures cohesive and functional design.
-   Identifies and addresses potential problems early.
-   Facilitates changes to the design without a complete overhaul.

**Leveraging Top-Down Modeling**
To create our bike phone mount, I employed the top-down modeling approach by importing an accurate model of bike handlebars within the specified dimensions and a model of an iPhone 13 Pro Max. This eliminated the need for constant dimension-checking and allowed for more efficient modeling.
	
This top-down modeling approach contributed significantly to the project in two key ways. First by ensuring a Cohesive Design. By beginning with the overall structure and then refining each component, I guaranteed that the final design would be seamless and that all parts would seamlessly interact. Furthermore, this approach allowed for Early Issue Identification. The top-down modeling technique helped me spot and fix potential design hiccups early on, saving time and resources and, ultimately resulting in a highly functional product.
    

By strategically using top-down modeling, I achieved a seamlessly integrated a fully integrated bike phone mount that met the project specifications.


### Material Choice

The bike phone mount was made out of PLA plastic. PLA is a durable and UV resistant plastic that is well-suited for outdoor use.

# Assembly Instructions

Assembling the Phone Mount is straightforward, and no additional tools are necessary. However, a small screwdriver may be helpful.


**Instructions:**

1.  Position the phone mount around the handlebars of your bike.
2.  Tighten the four screws to secure the mount in place.
3.  Insert the swivel ball into the holder.
4.  Slide the second arm of the phone holder into its designated slot.
5.  Place your phone in the space between the arms and tighten until it's securely held in place.

## Conclusion

By adhering to the top-down modeling approach, I created a reliable and user-friendly phone holder for bikes. This design ensures a secure attachment to the handlebars and enables quick phone installation, all while offering adjustable orientation for a seamless cycling experience. Whether you're a casual rider or a cycling enthusiast, our bike phone holder is a valuable addition to your outdoor adventures.
